  ### Format
  
 How to get USB to work on TV? The trick is to format the USB drive to a proper
 file system. If the USB drive uses an improper file system, it wonâ€™t be
 recognized and used by the TV. What file system is supported by your TV? In
 recent years, popular smart TV brands are Samsung, LG, Sony, Hisense, and TCL.
 In most cases, these TVs support the following USB formats.
 
>     Samsung: QLED and SUHD TVs support FAT, exFAT, and NTFS file systems, while
>              Full HD TVs support NTFS (Read-Only), FAT16, and FAT32.
