# Arch Fixes

## Fix “Warning: local is newer than community” Error In Arch Linux

If you get the following when running pacman to update:

`warning: youtube-dl: local (2017.01.22-1) is newer than community (2017.01.16-1)
nothing to do`

The following choices will fix the problem

This quick and dirty method SHOULD fix it, and update the packages as normal
`$ sudo pacman -Syu`

If that didn't work
`$ sudo pacman -Suu`

The above command will update all packages, then downgrade all affected packages.

And then, do the full upgrade using command
`$ sudo pacman -Syyu`
