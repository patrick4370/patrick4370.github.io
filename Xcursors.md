# LXAppearance 

LXAppearance sets the default cursor by creating an `~/.icons/default/index.theme` file: if you edited that file manually, 
LXAppearance will overwrite it. Remember to also edit `~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini` manually as specified in #XDG specification, 
because applications like Firefox use this setting instead.
